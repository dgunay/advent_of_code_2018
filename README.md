# Advent of Code 2018

A collection of solutions to Advent of Code 2018.

## General Approach

I want to get a bit better at C, so I'm trying to solve everything in C if
I can. If I have to implement a generic data structure in order to solve it,
I'll switch to C++. If I get frustrated, I'll use a scripting language.

Compile C examples with `gcc -Wall` and C++ examples with 
`g++ -Wall -std=c++14`.
